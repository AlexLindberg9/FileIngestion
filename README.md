Ingested and serialized a file using YAML, validated the column names and lengths, and exported it as a pipe separated gz file. 
NOTE: Didn't include CSV or GZ files due to size, but they can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/new-york-city/nyc-parking-tickets?select=Parking_Violations_Issued_-_Fiscal_Year_2017.csv
